4th December 1938

From: Colm O&#39;Brien
London, England

To: Deirdre MacKenna
Belfast, Northern Ireland

Dearest Deirdre, mo mhuirnín.

It has been nearly five years since we last met, yet I can still hear the enchanting sound of your voice in my ears. As I draw nearer to completing my apprenticeship I&#39;ve begun counting the days until I may return to Belfast, and to your side. Your last letter brought much delight to everyone, they delight in hearing tales of the misadventures of your students and agree that you must be the most understanding of teachers to put up with them! Work here has been neverending, which is useful for occupying my mind during the day and ensuring I fall quickly to sleep in the evening. I must confess that it&#39;s not just thoughts of missing you occupying my mind and keeping me awake. Germany is only becoming more aggressive, and since September I&#39;ve been hearing whispers in the street that England is preparing for war. I&#39;ve given it all the thought I can spare, and though as an irishman I will not be conscripted for war I feel it&#39;s my duty to volunteer for service in the British Army. I know what you will say, that we&#39;ve been separated for too long already, that I need not risk my life, but I know I must do this. I&#39;ve spent nigh on five years in England, and during this time it has been my home.

Please forgive me mo mhuirnín dílis, a chuisle mo chroí.

I await your [[reply|December 1938]].

Always and forever yours,

The war intensifies. Colm and Dee exchange letters and telegrams through the year, Colm telling stories of his fellow soldiers and his time in France and Dee regaling them all with stories of her students, and life in Belfast. Together they plan for the future and Colm&#39;s return from the war, both refusing to acknowledge that it may never happen.

LETTER

11th April 1941

From: Deirdre MacKenna
Belfast, Northern Ireland

To: Colm O&#39;Brien
Cyrenaica, Libya

My Dearest, Mo mhuirnín dílis,

I don&#39;t have much time to write, I just wanted to assure you I am safe and well for now. I took shelter under the stairs, but the bombs fell on the other side of the city and caused minimal damage. The thought of further attacks presses on me but I&#39;ve taken to distracting myself by sewing my wedding dress and imagining what our lives will be one day. Easter nears soon, and I&#39;m planning to attend the church service with Mam and Da before Easter Sunday lunch. I&#39;ve bought a new hat for the occasion and I must say it rather brings out my eyes and makes me feel quite fashionable.

I will write more soon Mo Stór, write back when you can.

Love always and forever,

Dee

Colm,

Forgive the delay of my letter but in the aftermath of the bombings it has been difficult to find the time, and the means to send mail. As I said in my telegram I am safe, though I confess myself rather shaken. The blitz last Tuesday was the second raid in as many weeks, and they said more are expected. I have heard in town that several young men at the football match spotted a lone Luftwaffe plane circling hours earlier. We had almost no warning, I had scarecely lain down to sleep when I heard the air raid siren begin. I roused myself as fast as I could and ran for the air raid shelter at Clonard Monastery. The shelter was located in the crypt underneath the sanctuary, and I found myself wondering if all we had done by gathering there was save the city the cost of moving our bodies after the raid was over. There was at least two hundred of us huddled in there, and it was a sombre mood to be sure. To keep the little ones calm and drown out the sound of bombs falling we said prayers and sung hymns. Finally when the air had been silent for a good while we ventured out to see what was left. It seemed half the city was on fire. People have been fleeing the city ever since, making for Dromara, Newtownards, Lisburn and even Dublin. I wish you were here with me. I will remain strong, have faith and look forward to the day we are united once more.

Deirdre MacKenna
